<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/EOEPCA/)

The Processing & Chaining domain area provides an extensible repository of processing functions, tools and applications that can be discovered by search query, invoked individually, and utilised in workflows. ADES is responsible for the execution of the processing service through both a [OGC WPS 1.0 & 2.0 OWS service](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wps) and an [OGC Processes REST API](https://github.com/opengeospatial/wps-rest-binding). The processing request are executed within the target Exploitation Platform (i.e., the one that is close to the data).

The ADES software uses [ZOO-Project](http://zoo-project.org/) as the main framework for exposing the OGC compliant web services. The [ZOO-kernel](http://zoo-project.org/docs/kernel/) powering the web services is included in the software package.

The ADES functions are designed to perform the processing and chaining function on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Calrissian Tool](https://github.com/Duke-GCB/calrissian). Calrissian uses CWL, that is a robust workflow engine, over Kubernetes that enables the implementation of each step in a workflow as a container. It provides simple, flexible mechanisms for specifying constraints between the steps in a workflow and artifact management for linking the output of any step as an input to subsequent steps.
